  <h3 class="text-[20px] font-semibold my-[16px]">What are cookies?</h3>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device's memory.
    A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated,
    the "lifetime" of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar
    identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing
    history and activities conducted while using our services.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-[20px] font-semibold my-[16px]">Are there different types of cookies?</h3>
  <h4 class="text-[18px] font-semibold my-[16px]">First-party and third-party cookies</h4>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your device directly
    by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser's language preferences
    and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our
    partners and service providers. You can learn more about these partners and service providers through
    our website and in-app consent management tools. For details on these tools, see "How can you control
    cookies?" below.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-[18px] font-semibold my-[16px]">Session and persistent cookies</h4>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close your browser.
    We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website
    during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently. Persistent cookies
    have a longer lifespan and last beyond the current session. These types of cookies can be used to help
    you quickly sign-in to our website again, for analytical purposes and for other reasons as described below.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-[20px] font-semibold my-[16px]">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons and SDKs?</h3>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixel, tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software
    development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes as cookies. Web beacons are tiny graphics files
    that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our service or
    opened an e-mail that we have sent them. Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand
    where the traffic to our webpages comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which
    function like cookies and web beacons.
  </p>
  <p class="my-[16px]">For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as "cookies" in this Cookie Policy.</p>
  <h3 class="text-[20px] font-semibold my-[16px]">What do we use cookies for?</h3>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    Like other providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services,
    including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our website, measuring
    the success of our marketing campaigns and personalizing and tailoring ads to your interests.
    To accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other personal
    information we hold about you.
  </p>
  <p class="my-[16px]">When you use our services, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your device.</p>
  <table>

          remembering your preferences and keeping you safe by detecting malicious activity.

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Advertising & marketing cookies</strong></td>
        <td>
          These cookies are used to determine how effective our marketing campaigns are and make the ads you
          see more relevant to you. They perform functions like helping us understand how much traffic our
          marketing campaigns drive on our services, preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing,
          ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, selecting advertisements relevant to
          you and measuring the number of ads displayed and their performance, such as how many people
          interacted with a given ad.
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Social networking cookies</strong></td>

          These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our

          also be used for advertising purposes.

  </table>
  <h3 class="text-[20px] font-semibold my-[16px]">How can you control cookies?</h3>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    There are several cookie management options available to you. Please note that changes you make to your
    cookie preferences may make using our services a less satisfying experience as they may not be as
    personalized to you. In some cases, you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our services.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-[18px] font-semibold my-[16px]">Tools we provide</h4>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    You can set and adjust your cookies preferences at any time, by using the tool available on our website,
    and by heading to your account settings in your app and adjusting your app cookie preferences there.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-[18px] font-semibold my-[16px]">Browser and devices controls</h4>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when
    a cookie is placed on your computer. The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for
    each internet browser. You can check the specific steps in your particular browser help menu.
  </p>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    You also may be able to reset device identifiers or opt-out from having identifiers collected or
    processed by using the appropriate setting on your mobile device. The procedures for managing
    identifiers are slightly different for each device. You can check the specific steps in the help
    or settings menu of your particular device.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-[18px] font-semibold my-[16px]">Interest-based advertising tools</h4>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    Advertising companies may participate in self-regulatory programs which allow you to opt out of
    any interest-based ads involving them. For more information on this, you can visit the following
    sites: Digital Advertising Alliance; Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance; Appchoices (apps only).
  </p>
  <p class="my-[16px]">
    Opting out does not mean that you will not see advertising - it means you won't see personalized
    advertising from the companies that participate in the opt-out programs. Also, if you delete cookies
    on your device after you opted out, you will need to opt-out again.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-[20px] font-semibold my-[16px]">Google™ Cookies</h3>
