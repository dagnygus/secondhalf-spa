# SecondhalfSpa - Dating app

This project was created for showcasing development skills.
The content is for the assessment of recruiters looking for people who are well acquainted in Angular framework.
I have made every effort to adhere to proper practices of modern Angulara development.
However, I did not use standaolone components becouse it was originally made in the version yet not
supporting it.  

Primary focus points: 
  - On push change detection
  - Coding reactively
  - Smart/dump components architecture
  - modularity

External dependencies: 
  - Angular Material
  - Tailwind
  - Date-fns
  - Angular-fire

Backend of this application was implememtet in firebase, using cloud functions, storage, auth and firestore.
